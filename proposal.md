I want to make my bot able to solve math. Like 2+4, 2*2, and 2//2. I would like to call it something along the lines of. //botmath_add(). And in the () will be the math it will solve for. I would also like for the bot to count for me. Like if I put 5 periods it will say "You have 5 done!". Also a small thing. I would like it if the bot code translate my words into cipher? If possible.
